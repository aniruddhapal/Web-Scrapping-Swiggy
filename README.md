# Web-Scrapping-Swiggy

Using Python and BeautifulSoup, I created a script that collected information on thousands of restaurants listed on the Swiggy platform, including their names, ratings, menus, and more. After cleaning and organizing the data, I was able to create a comprehensive dataset that can be used for further analysis and insights.

This Code creates seperate .csv file location wise and you can change the latitude and longitude to change location as per your requirement.
